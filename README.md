# Project Name

## Description
A brief description of what the project does and its features.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to set up and run the project using Docker Compose.

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
    cd yourrepository
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Project

1. Start the services using Docker Compose:
    ```sh
    docker-compose up
    ```

2. Access the application at `http://localhost:8000` (or the port you have configured).

## Things to be fixed

- Clean the code to improve readability and maintainability.
- Ensure that `__pycache__` directories are not included in the repository. You can add the following to your `.gitignore` file:
    ```sh
    __pycache__/
    ```

### Example .gitignore
    ```
    # Virtual Environment
    venv/
    
    # Python cache
    __pycache__/
    *.py[cod]
    ```
